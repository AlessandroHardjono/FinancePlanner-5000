Finance Planner 5000
==========

The Finance Planner 5000 is a personal project with the goal of learning the basics of Software Engineering.

## Functions

This project is a simple calculator that keeps track of your money. Not much emphasis is put into its purpose, as this project is mostly used as a playground to further understand the semantics of Java.

Features include:
- adding money to the balance,
- subtracting the balance through spending,
- and taking advantage of API to display the currency exchange.

This program uses a simple graphical user interface using JSON and swing, where it shows simple message and input window (depending on the feature).
