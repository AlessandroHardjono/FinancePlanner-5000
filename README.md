Finance Planner 5000
==========

The Finance Planner 5000 is a personal project with the goal of learning the basics of Software Engineering.
This project is used for the CPSC210(Introduction to Software Engineering) course taken in the University of British Columbia, Vancouver.

## Functions

This project is a simple calculator that keeps track of your money. Not much emphasis is put into its purpose, as this project is mostly used a playground to further understand the semantics of the Java language.
Features include adding money to the balance, subtracting the balance through spending, and taking advantage of API to display today's date.
This program uses a simple graphical user interface using JSon and swing, where there is a simple message and input window (depending on the features).
